# Text Anim

The animation library/software I use to animate in a tty environment.

## Requirements

`python` version `3.10` or later must be installed.

## Usage

This is a simple way to create an animation

- Create a `runme.py` in the main folder.
- Copy this starter code into `runme.py`:
	```py
	from text_anim.interpreter import interpret_file
	interpret_file('animation.anim')
	```
- Create a `animation.anim` in the main folder.
- Make your animation in `animation.anim`.
- Run it by running `runme.py`.
